# agent.rse

The agent attempts to autonously install a given open source research software repository. Agent.rse performs its task in two stages: i) it gathers documentation related to the installation and ii) it tries to build, generate ,and if necessary, repair, a README to install and test the target repository. 

**Agent.rse** autonomously explore multiple tools to:

- repair issues in installation-related GitHub readmes,
- find cybersecurity vulnerabilities (by solving Capture The Flag challenges),
- simplify plans installation, or
- generate plans for installation

**Agent.rse** is built and maintained by researchers from OEG group. It's an academic research project started at UPM University as part of my PhD thesis.
